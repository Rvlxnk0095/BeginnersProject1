These are simple while learning pyhton basics.
4 simple excercises: 
  1. Weight Convertor:- This is a simple program that converts weight kilograms to pounds and vice-versa.
  Here, we use if-else statements  only.
  2. Number Guess Game:- In this program, number have to be guessed with the limit of three. If the number guessed is right then the program gives the output as (You Won!)
  and if not in three guesses then (You Lose!). Here, we use while loop and if-else statements.
  3. Car Game:- In this program, instructions are taken as (input namely start,stop,help,quit). If the instruction says start then output should be (Car Started....Ready to go!),
  for stop(Car stopped!), help(gives the description of all instructions) and quit terminates the program.
  Here, we use while loop an if-else statements.
  4. Level Up:- This is the modified form of car game program. In this some changes are made so that when once the start instruction is given then the next time it should give the
  output as (Car already started.), similarly for stop instruction.
  Here, we use while loop and if-else statements ,bool.
